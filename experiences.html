				This past summer, I was a Marketing and Business Development intern at People & Computers, a HiTech event and conference organizer in Tel Aviv, Israel.
				During this internship, I focused on marketing the Innov8Work Conference by working on community outreach to find sponsors and participants through LinkedIn and email.
				I also used my Hebrew skills to translate advertisements for the conference that the company used to market towards their English-speaking audience.
			</p>
			<p class = 'p-for-experiences'>In the past, I was a Data Science intern at FORKAIA, where I had the opportunity to increase my interest in data and technology.
				At FORKAIA, I worked with other interns to clean and organize data related to up and coming start-ups.

			<h3 class = 'header-for-experiences'>Volunteer Experiences</h3>
			<p class = 'p-for-experiences'>

				At the start of the COVID-19 Pandemic, I found a group of college students from around the country 
				interested in using innovative technologies to help society in the midst of a global pandemic, and helped to create a platform called Corona Connects. 
			</p>
				<p class = 'p-for-experiences'>
					Eventually, I became the Southern California regional coordinator for Corona Connects, a platform that seamlessly connected volunteers to hundreds of COVID-related opportunities.
				In High School, I was involved in an organizaton called Wise Readers to Leaders, which was a camp benefiting underprivileged elementary school children providing free educational and recreational 
				activities to promote a love of reading. I was a both a literacy leader and a member of their Executive Board.
