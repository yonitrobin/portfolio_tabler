				I am a Junior at the University of Michigan, School of Information. 
			I'm majoring in Information Analysis, which is essentially studying business, technology, and society, and how to use data and 
			technology to further analyze the intersections of these fields.

				I am also minoring in Judaic studies, and am very active in the Jewish community on campus, particularly with Hillel, the student organization for Jewish students.
			I am currently serving as the Finance Chair on the Undergraduate Governing Board Hillel, where I manage budgets for events and programming.
			In the past, I have been involved in Freshmen class programming as well as having been a JNet fellow, where I helped build Jewish community among freshmen as well as within my social sorority.

				On the weekends, I love spending time with friends, exploring Ann Arbor, and going to Football games. Go Blue!
